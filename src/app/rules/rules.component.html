  <h3>Gameplay</h3>
  <div>
     On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly until either:
     <ul>
       <li>1 is rolled</li>
       <li>The player chooses to hold (stop rolling)</li>
     </ul>

     <div>If a 1 is rolled, that player's turn ends and no points are earned.</div>
     <div>If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.</div>
  </div>

  <h3>Scoring Examples</h3>
  <div>
    Example 1: Sherri rolls a 3 and decides to continue. She then chooses to roll seven more times (6, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, 1). Because
    she rolled a 1, Sherri's turn ends and she earns 0 points. Example 2: Craig rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He then chooses
    to roll four more times (3, 4, 2, 6) and decides to hold. Craig earns 21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6=21). Game End When
    a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
